Black-hole-simulation-using-python
==================================

Non-spinning black hole simulation based on photon geodesic equation.
This program takes an equirectangular image and returns the image distorded by the black hole.
Results can be saved in form of matrices to call them later.
An offset system can be used to simulate a moving background by saving a series of simulations with different offset.

An optional GUI can be used to controle the BlackHole class.
